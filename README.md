# Salary_Prediction_Analysis
Machine Learning Project
A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted, followed by feature engineering and data preprocessing. Machine learning models including linear regression, decision tree, and random forest were deployed to predict salaries. The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Random Forest emerged as the model providing the most accurate salary predictions.
